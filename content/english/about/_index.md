I'm Hugo, I'm a backend engineer. I truly enjoy working with backend services that need to be able to handle high throughput and databases with many entries. Like a cargo ship, I also enjoy containers, I enjoy them the most when they are orchestrated by Kubernetes. The containers I like the most are the ones with code written but not limited to in Golang, Python, or Node.
